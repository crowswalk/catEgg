# catEgg

## Game objective: Feed the CAT. It is hungry for FISH.
* To get FISH, you need a FISHING ROD and BAIT.
	* The FISHING ROD is in the CHEST.
* To get BAIT, you need EGGS, COAL, and the FURNACE.
	* For EGGS, you need to feed ACORNS to the CHICKENS.
		* To collect ACORNS, you need a SACK. The SACK is in the CHEST.
	* For COAL, you need to ask your NEIGHBOR.
	* Take the EGG and COAL to the furnace. It will return BAIT.

## BEHAVIORS:
### CHEST: Touching the chest opens it and reveals a bubble showing the items it contains.
Clicking the items adds them to your inventory.

### THOUGHTS: Thought bubble will give clues throughout the game:
* Your CAT is HUNGRY. You need to FISH from the POND. 
* The FISH are avoiding you because you need BAIT.
* For BAIT you need EGGS. Feed ACORNS to the CHICKENS.
* You need COAL. Neighbor will give you some.
* You need to cook the EGGS with the COAL at your FURNACE.

## To Do (3/22):
#### BUGS/ISSUES TO FIX: 
- [ ] jitter when fish swim away
- [ ] key disappears from cat's necklace before protag says they'll take it
- [ ] interactions happen too fast (i.e. the fish are caught very quickly, bait is cooked instantaneously)
- [ ] Need visual feedback for when player picks coal from bag
- [ ] chickens don't always poop out the egg in the right direction, if at all. (Note: the player still gains an egg after feeding the chicken, but the sprite isn't always visible)

#### Final additions:
- [ ] Giving fish to cat & ending cutscene
- [ ] Background sprites
